## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Setup

To set up your Supabase database, you have several options:

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
1. Run the setup guide: `open supabase-setup-guide.html` in your browser
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Create a Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com/
2. Create the required tables:
   - `candidates` table with columns: id, name, project, created_at
   - `votes` table with columns: id, voter_name, voter_email, candidate_id, candidate_name, candidate_project, vote_timestamp
3. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for both tables

#### Option 3: Scripted Setup
1. Get your Supabase service role key from the dashboard
2. Update `supabase-setup-simple.js` with your credentials
3. Run: `node supabase-setup-simple.js`

### 2. Application Configuration

The application is already configured with your Supabase credentials:
- URL: `https://fgpfkmbrnrhddznpnmbz.supabase.co`
- Anon Key: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImZncGZrbWJybnJoZGR6bnBubWJ6Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjY4OTc2ODIsImV4cCI6MjA4MjQ3MzY4Mn0.s_2dlVd3zH8GlshtzDW_znSMxbcxTXuvgHkCNpo4kJc`

### 3. Running the Application

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## File Structure

- `voting.html` - Voting page with candidate selection
- `leaderboard.html` - Real-time leaderboard
- `admin.html` - Admin panel for managing candidates
- `dashboard.html` - Voting analytics dashboard

## Supabase Tables

### candidates
- `id` (int8, primary key)
- `name` (text)
- `project` (text)
- `created_at` (timestamptz)

### votes
- `id` (int8, primary key)
- `voter_name` (text)
- `voter_email` (text)
- `candidate_id` (int8)
- `candidate_name` (text)
- `candidate_project` (text)
- `vote_timestamp` (timestamptz)

## Troubleshooting

### "Candidates table not found" error
This usually indicates a Row Level Security (RLS) configuration issue:
1. Ensure RLS is enabled for both tables
2. Create SELECT policies with `true` as the USING expression
3. For votes table, also create INSERT policy with `true` as the WITH CHECK expression

### "Permission denied" error
Check your RLS policies as described above.
